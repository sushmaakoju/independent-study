## Independent Study: Study and design of NER & Text extraction from OCR scanned Handwritten Slave Trade Volumes
### Prof. Henry Lovejoy, Digital Slavery Research Lab and Dr. Jane Wall, Faculty Director, Data Science

I worked on an Independent Study supervised by Prof. Henry Lovejoy for the Digital Slavery Research Lab, at the University of Colorado, Boulder. It was towards study and design of Named Entity Recognition from OCR scanned Handwritten Slave Trade Volumes and to train a search over OCR scanned documents. The goal was to analyze and emancipate both people and present-impressions of the past: <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/dsrl/collaborators">Digital Slavery Research Lab / collaborators</a>.

- The challenge here was Named Entity Recognition needs to run over the text extracted from 19th century English language text corpus. Performance over BERT under zero-shot settings was poor for 80% of vocabulary. So we used <a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/macberth-eval">MacBERTh</a> model.
